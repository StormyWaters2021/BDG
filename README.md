Bomb Defusal Game

This game uses a Raspberry Pi Pico, a handful of hardware, and a "manual" to create a fake "bomb" that must be defused to win the game. 

When the game starts, it creates a randomized set of win conditions - the switches, buttons, wires, etc. that must be changed in order to "defuse the bomb". 
The flashing LEDs and the "Serial Number" printed on the LCD offer information to help determine what must be done to win. Using this information,
and the instructions in the Bomb Defusal Manual, you have 5 minutes to solve the puzzle.
